<h4>Riser Clamps</h4>

**Cloned from ckunte's [riser clamps repo](https://github.com/ckunte/rclamp).**
<p> On execution input and results will be written in file 'clamps.txt', located in same folder as script.</p>
Required: [inout.py](https://github.com/ddjokic/Python-Bin)</p>
<h5>Riser Clamps Bolting Check</h5>
<p> Although Bolting check is part of riser clamps design check, sometimes is required to do "fast and not so dirty" bolting check. To avoid long input, I pulled out bolting part check from allclamp script.</p>
Bolting check usage is not limited only to the riser clamp, but to all connections with similar loading scheme - refer to 'rclamp.png' file.</p>
Input and results will be written in file 'clamps-bolting.txt' after execution of the script.</p>
